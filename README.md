# Check Compliance of the resources created in your organizations and Modify them as per compliance policy
As a Cloud Engineering team we take care of the AWS environment and make sure it is in compliance with the organizational policies.
We use AWS cloud watch in combination with AWS Lambda to govern the resources according to the policies.
For example, we Trigger a Lambda function when an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is created. We use Amazon CloudWatch Events. CloudWatch Events that allows us to monitor and respond to EBS volumes that are of type GP2 and convert them to type GP3.
